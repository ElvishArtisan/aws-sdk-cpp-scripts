This is the installation file for the aws-sdk-cpp-scripts package.

Basic Setup
-----------
1) Check out the source code for the AWS C++ API from GitHub. (See
instructions at https://sdk.amazonaws.com/cpp/api/LATEST/root/html/index.html).

  Example:
    cd ~/dev
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp

2) Define 'AWS_SDK_CPP_S3_SOURCE' in your environment to point to the top
of the checked out source tree.

  Example:
    Add the following line to '~/.bashrc':
      export AWS_SDK_CPP_S3_SOURCE=$HOME/dev/aws-sdk-cpp

3) Initialize the build system by doing:

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
